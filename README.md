# Algorithms-of-Box-and-Wisker-Plot
This is the algorithm assignment that i assigned during my second year of computer science.

About this algorithm

The box and whisker plot which is usually called as box plot is used in various fields to visualize the distribution of data and understand its main statistical properties. I intend to use my algorithm in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and finical analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – analysts use box plots to summarize main features of a dataset, such as median, quartiles and potential outliers.
Finical Analysis – Investors use box plots to visualize the range of returns for different investments and to assess risk.
